## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
filepath <- 'amazonsellers.csv'
df <- read.csv(filepath)
df
```

```{r}

```

CLEAN DATA WITH THIS SQUARE

```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(., code = trimws(as.character(code)))
df <- df %>% mutate(., q_count = trimws(as.character(q_count)))
df <- df %>% mutate(., q_count = gsub(" answered questions", "", q_count))

df <- df %>% mutate(., rev_count = gsub(" ratings", "", rev_count))

df <- df %>% mutate(., q_count = ifelse(q_count == "", 0, q_count))

df <- df %>% mutate(., rev_count = ifelse(rev_count == "", 0, rev_count))


df <- df %>% mutate(., star = as.character(star))
df <- df %>% mutate(., star = ifelse(nchar(star) < 5,"0.0 out of 5 stars", ifelse(nchar(star) > 18, "0.0 out of 5 stars", star )))

df <- df %>% mutate(., price = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", substring(as.character(price), 2))))

df
```


```{r}
dff <- df %>% mutate(., price = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", substring(as.character(price), 2))))



#dff <- dff %>% mutate(., seller = as.character(seller))
```

```{r}
gs = dff %>% group_by(seller) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% filter(., count > 2)
gp = dff %>% group_by(product) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% filter(., count > 1)

gs
gp

dff
distinct(dff)

```


```{r}
dff %>% filter(., code == 3660029)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
