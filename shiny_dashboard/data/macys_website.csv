I purchased the watch in May and its June and it's already broken. I have very careful with my watches. I was taken the watch off, but it fell into pieces. I didn't purchase the extended warranty, so I had to come out my pocket to fix it. I took it to a watch repair man, but he said I had to purchase another band, because the pin that holds it together, is short. I am disappointed because I love this watch.

*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist.

However, I got fairly surprised that after wearing it for a day or two, I was actually getting pretty accurate time readings to as close as being 2 minutes off all the time. For general use, being within 2 minutes accuracy is already very good functionally speaking and most people don't really need more than that. Therefore, I would now even recommend this not only for its stylish looks for fashion but also for general use.,Great stylish gift, It’s been 2 months and I’m still in love with this purchase.

It’s timeless and the quality is there. The leather strap is very nice, the crystal is beautifully clear. It keeps time perfectly. Getting this with a twenty-five percent discount was just icing on the cake. Just buy it, you’ll be delighted also.,Very Chic, If you’re looking for a piece that’ll add the right touch to your guys outfit look no further. Whether he’s dressing up on something casual this Watch is stunning. I chose this over the Gucci (the Gucci looks very feminine) nice masculine watch but not too bulky,Beautiful Timepiece, I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband. He isn't into over the top or flashy so this was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful classic look with a nice leather band. Very clean looking with just a pop of gold. He LOVES it! For someone that is hard to shop for, this made my day!,My wife loves it., It was the perfect gift for our 43 anniversary. The watch was an aesy choice at a good price.,The best watch for me, I love it, It's super awesome! I can wear it all day without getting annoy by it. It is very lightweight so I can't hardly feel its weight on my wrist.,SO CLASSY!, I just bought this watch and it feels so good! Looks amazing and gurl i got so many compliments on it! Trust me less is more with this watch!!!! Perfect size not too bulky and super comfortable! GLAM LIFE!,BEST WATCH EVER, MY LAST PREMIUM WATCH WAS A GUCCI AND IT IS STILL BEAUTIFL AND WORKING. THIS IS SUPER SIMPLE AND SO SO CLASSY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY AGAIN. BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BEST FOR A MATURE WOMEN OR A CAREER LADY. NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A TEENAGER.,Beautiful watch, What a stunning watch this is. It is a very classic looking watch. One that never goes out of style. The face is simple, elegant yet makes a bold statement.
The band is beautiful as well. I wish they made this same watch in a ladies.... I almost kept it for myself instead of giving it as a gift.,I got this Movado watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. As soon as he opened the box his face got light up when he saw this amazing watch. He loves that is very light weight and that he can wear it for so many ocassions. Thank you Macy’s for making my Christmas Day extra special!,The timepiece is lightweight, classic and looks exactly as pictured. Due to the cognac band and black watchface it could go with just about everything! The quality is absolutely amazing! In classic Movado form this doesn't have number dials but while looking at it you can imagine the dials on there and still be able to tell time or simply wear it as a fashion piece. I love this timepiece and the Movado brand!,Perfect watch, boyfriend loves it! It is simple and elegant. It can be worn as an everyday watch to work, date night or with a suit. Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist. I sometimes prefer wearing a man’s watch and this one is perfect without looking too large and over the top. Highly recommend this watch as the perfect, classic accessory to up-level any outfit for guys or all the on-trend ladies out there!",Extra 25% off use: FRIEND,https://www.macys.com/shop/product/movado-swiss-museum-classic-collection-leather-strap-watches?ID=6273059&CategoryID=65993&isDlp=true,Men's Swiss Museum Classic Black Leather Strap Watch 40mm

I have a small wrist and it still looks nice. and not overpowering.,Had my eye on this watch for almost a year and received it as a birthday gift. Immediately fell in love with it. It has a nice heavy feel to it, reminding you of the Swiss quality. The clasps are very strong, unlike the michael kors watch clasps that feel very cheap and easy to break. I was considering between the movado or Burberry watch, but the quality of Movado is way better, plus movado solely makes watches where as burberry has fossil make their watches for them. Plus why would anyone want to buy a fancied out fossil watch with the burberry price tag.,The rose gold over the silver is indeed very eye catching, and can add to formal clothes, or bring a touch of class to your everyday work/school clothing. I get compliments on the watch all the time. The movado brand is the easiest to spot on wrists as far as watches are concerned. Then again the color could have been phlegm green and the watch would still get compliments because, hey, ultimately its a movado on your wrist screaming middle class luxury.,Lastly, a few cons to consider: as with most chain linked watches, there will be scratches and scuffs... unless you baby the watch.. it is impossible to avoid scratches from daily use. Also, it is difficult to tell the time on the watch, I usually use my cellphone because its nearly impossible to know the exact time when reading the watch. Even the hour hand can get confusing, so do not rely on the watch if you need one for time.,Overall, great watch for college age students or someone just starting their career.

Style #0607184,$595.00,98%,12,"Movado, enough said!!, First of all, Movado is known around the world by its outstanding quality and beautiful designs, this one is a great example of what Movado stands for. I had been looking for an elegant and classic watch to wear on special occasions, this one is just perfect, just what I was looking for. The two tone bangle bracelet, the black dial and the famous signature dot make a great combination of elegance and good taste. This watch is easy to match with any outfit, very sleek, feminine and easily sizeable, it is a small watch which to me is great because I have a small wrist. It comes beautifully packed in a box, where you can keep it while not wearing it. Great choice if you are looking for a stylish and fine watch!!!,Up, up, upscale, I am no stranger to Movado watches as I own three, 2 somewhat “gifted” and I must say they are consistent in their timeless design of class. This watch is very beautiful and ultra feminine and that’s good in an era of large and bulky watches. With this watch you are definite to wear for formal affairs as the two tone, gold and silver, will compliment any attire. There is more silver than gold, but well placed and designed! The two toned color elements also allows one to wear jewelry without fear of any clashing. I especially love it’s face. It has a black background and gold hands and the signature gold circle at the 12 o’clock position makes reading time effortless and beautiful. There are extra links for those wrists that aren’t as small as mine making wear a possibility for all. You can definitely wear this with less formal or on those “whatever” days, but it’s so good to have a two toned watch to fit the high end events. Movado rocks!!!!!,Very Elegant!!!, I absolutely love this beautiful two toned Movado watch which is exactly my style. It matches everything from day-to-evening wear adding a simple touch of class and elegance. My only complaint was that is it slightly snug as the top it is designed as more of a bracelet and the lower part dangles but over time I realized that made it considerably easier to secure the snap with one hand. Also, I love glitter and shine and this lights up the room bringing well needed attention to my wrist!,Well it’s a Movado! So........, This watch is very elegant. It works so well with all colors because it is silver with gold accents so works with everything. I have received many compliments! It fits perfectly with no adjustments needed, it is very easy to get on and off and the clasp is very secure. The only issue is I must now get my nails done so I can adequately represent this beautiful timepiece! Lol!,This is Not a Watch, In an effort to review the Movado Womens Swiss Amorosa Bangle Bracelet timepiece, the words “sleek” and “stylish” although accurate, fall short of truly defining the experience. It fits just like an open link bracelet, made of highly polished stainless steel, with contrasting gold tone trim that accentuates its mirrored finish. The unmistakable deep black face and signature accent at high noon, clearly reveal this hidden gem to be Movado. Shipped securely, requiring a signature upon delivery, and packaged inside several nesting boxes, I found the clasp sure and certain, and the look, stunning. Honestly, wearing it transported me to an era when art deco was in vogue. It demanded my finest apparel, insisting I casually show it off all evening. I have watches, I love my watches, but once this beauty adorned my wrist, I was defenseless. This is not a watch...it’s a Movado.,Hands smaller, Originally bought next one up.. with diamond insets. Exchanged it for this one to save money. The hands on this one do seem smaller which is disappointing as the reason so bought it was to be able to read it without glasses on,Classic Feminine Beauty, I cannot say enough about this watch, it is absolutely gorgeous. Wear it and it will speak for itself. I have the two tone gold tone stainless model. The face is the ""star "" here and the side bracelets enhance its beauty. I love the gold accents on the hands and the bracelets, and of course the Movado 12 o'clock dot. The bracelets taper off into links on each side and there is a secure clasp. I have a 6 1/2 inch wrist and still have plenty of room to remove a link. It is a very comfortable watch and goes on and off easily. I like my bracelets/watches to fit loose and this falls nicely onto my hand. The watch is smaller than the watches today and is a timeless and classic beauty. This Movado shines on the wrist and I cannot stop looking at it. I highly recommend this feminine watch that can be passed on to loved ones.,Not on my Watch., This is a very nice watch, it has links so you can adjust it if you need to. It fits my wrist nice. It's a casual watch but you can dress it up with other jewelry.,Classy Movado, Love the classic silver Movado with a touch of gold. The watch can be worn with various gold or silver accessories, did I mention it’s a classic that never goes out of style. If you have a small wrist (like me) you will need to have it sized. The richness of the black face with gold 12 bezel is significant sign of Movado class and style. I’m like the youth who use their phone to tell time, I still wear watches. Love it.,Classic timepiece, Love this watch. It is light and classy. You can wear it to work or an after 5 dinner. It compliments a lady wrist because it is small and delicate. The gold and silver allows it to compliment anybody wardrobe. The bangle look seals the deal. LOVE LOVE LOVE it,Most amazing watch, This is an absolutely positively stunning piece. It is amazing and it can be worn with a tennis skirt, or dress it up with a little black dress. It is a classic and timeless brand that everybody knows, and I can be extremely proud of.,Frequent Buyer at Macys, I bought this watch 8 yrs ago o maybe a little longer. The Best Watch Ever.

Just buy it, you’ll be delighted also.,Very Chic, If you’re looking for a piece that’ll add the right touch to your guys outfit look no further. Whether he’s dressing up on something casual this Watch is stunning. I chose this over the Gucci (the Gucci looks very feminine) nice masculine watch but not too bulky,Beautiful Timepiece, I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband. He isn't into over the top or flashy so this was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful classic look with a nice leather band. Very clean looking with just a pop of gold. He LOVES it! For someone that is hard to shop for, this made my day!,My wife loves it., It was the perfect gift for our 43 anniversary. The watch was an aesy choice at a good price.,The best watch for me, I love it, It's super awesome! I can wear it all day without getting annoy by it. It is very lightweight so I can't hardly feel its weight on my wrist.,SO CLASSY!, I just bought this watch and it feels so good! Looks amazing and gurl i got so many compliments on it! Trust me less is more with this watch!!!! Perfect size not too bulky and super comfortable! GLAM LIFE!,BEST WATCH EVER, MY LAST PREMIUM WATCH WAS A GUCCI AND IT IS STILL BEAUTIFL AND WORKING. THIS IS SUPER SIMPLE AND SO SO CLASSY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY AGAIN. BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BEST FOR A MATURE WOMEN OR A CAREER LADY. NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A TEENAGER.,Beautiful watch, What a stunning watch this is. It is a very classic looking watch. One that never goes out of style. The face is simple, elegant yet makes a bold statement.
The band is beautiful as well. I wish they made this same watch in a ladies.... I almost kept it for myself instead of giving it as a gift.,I got this Movado watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. As soon as he opened the box his face got light up when he saw this amazing watch. He loves that is very light weight and that he can wear it for so many ocassions. Thank you Macy’s for making my Christmas Day extra special!,The timepiece is lightweight, classic and looks exactly as pictured. Due to the cognac band and black watchface it could go with just about everything! The quality is absolutely amazing! In classic Movado form this doesn't have number dials but while looking at it you can imagine the dials on there and still be able to tell time or simply wear it as a fashion piece. I love this timepiece and the Movado brand!,Perfect watch, boyfriend loves it! It is simple and elegant. It can be worn as an everyday watch to work, date night or with a suit. Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist.

The watch is very elegant, modern in design and sportive chronograph feature adds extra value on that. This is a new edition in my watches collection. This watch fits on my wrist (medium/small size wrist) very well and is very easy to use. It looks great with jeans during casual date/night outing.
The gunmetal color makes the watch distinctive and the finishing is excellent in quality. Not too heavy in weight and the genuine leather strap band really reduces the extra weight from the watch band but makes the watch significantly attractive and elegant in design. I strongly recommend this watch to those who are looking for designer watches that are elegant, cool and also has sportive looks plus chronograph feature at the same time.,This Men's wonderful designer watch has the below features:,Body: Gunmetal stainless steel round shape and a black chronograph dial with date window
Movement: Swiss made three-hand quartz chronograph
Case-back: Stainless steel

Dial: Black chronograph dial with date window, Date displays at 4 o'clock
Strap is made with Genuine Leather
Crystal: Sapphire crystal
Crown: Screw-down
Water resistant.,I've only worn it a handful of times but been in love with it ever since. I get compliments everywhere I go. The picture does not do justice at all, it looks sophisticated, elegant yet sporty on the wrist. The dial is 43mm which does not look overly large but rather compact and definitely solid. The brown band and black face matches everything. Leather strap is great quality and darker than the picture.The build quality and intuitive functionality are world class. This is my first Movado watch and I am positive now that it won't be the last!,Very sleek and modern watch with a timeless, clean and classic look. Overall I really like the watch more than I would have imagined. I receive many compliments with most curious on what brand the watch is. I feel like it is a good addition to the movado company collection with the focus on appealing to the millennial population. The leather seems like very good quality and that it will wear well. Lastly the size of the watch face was perfect...anything smaller would not have a masculine feel to it.,The main issue I have is that the straps are abnormally short...shorter then most other watches in their collection. This is the main reason that I’ve given the watch 4 stars.,This is a high end swiss men’s watch. It has a black chronograph dial face contrasted with stainless steel details. It comes with a sturdy well made leather strap. I found the color scheme elegant and timeless.,It is water resistant and has a clear date window. It would be suitable for work or a night out. The finishes and steel details of the watch lend a sophisticated feel. I enjoy wearing it on a daily basis. The size of the face of the watch makes it easy to tell the time. It serves a dual function- it tells time and is a nice statement piece.

It is a good weight. It did not weigh my wrist down when I wore it. It has many modern design elements and is a handsome timepiece. It is also professional looking.,I enjoy wearing this watch out and would highly recommend it.,A quite tastefully appearing timepiece. But, Does not wear well. I only wear this watch two to three times a week, business casual, evening dinner etc. after a few months the enamel on the bezel is showing wear, Though the Strap holds up very well. Fairly accurate, a few minutes off a month, Not the easiest task to set Day and Date either. I'll spend a few hundred more on my next watch and go bag to Tag.,My boyfriend saw this watch in store and fell in love with it. It's super chic without being flashy. Very good quality.

Whether he’s dressing up on something casual this Watch is stunning. I chose this over the Gucci (the Gucci looks very feminine) nice masculine watch but not too bulky,Beautiful Timepiece, I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband. He isn't into over the top or flashy so this was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful classic look with a nice leather band. Very clean looking with just a pop of gold. He LOVES it! For someone that is hard to shop for, this made my day!,My wife loves it., It was the perfect gift for our 43 anniversary. The watch was an aesy choice at a good price.,The best watch for me, I love it, It's super awesome! I can wear it all day without getting annoy by it. It is very lightweight so I can't hardly feel its weight on my wrist.,SO CLASSY!, I just bought this watch and it feels so good! Looks amazing and gurl i got so many compliments on it! Trust me less is more with this watch!!!! Perfect size not too bulky and super comfortable! GLAM LIFE!,BEST WATCH EVER, MY LAST PREMIUM WATCH WAS A GUCCI AND IT IS STILL BEAUTIFL AND WORKING. THIS IS SUPER SIMPLE AND SO SO CLASSY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY AGAIN. BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BEST FOR A MATURE WOMEN OR A CAREER LADY. NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A TEENAGER.,Beautiful watch, What a stunning watch this is. It is a very classic looking watch. One that never goes out of style. The face is simple, elegant yet makes a bold statement.
The band is beautiful as well. I wish they made this same watch in a ladies.... I almost kept it for myself instead of giving it as a gift.,I got this Movado watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. As soon as he opened the box his face got light up when he saw this amazing watch. He loves that is very light weight and that he can wear it for so many ocassions. Thank you Macy’s for making my Christmas Day extra special!,The timepiece is lightweight, classic and looks exactly as pictured. Due to the cognac band and black watchface it could go with just about everything! The quality is absolutely amazing! In classic Movado form this doesn't have number dials but while looking at it you can imagine the dials on there and still be able to tell time or simply wear it as a fashion piece. I love this timepiece and the Movado brand!,Perfect watch, boyfriend loves it! It is simple and elegant. It can be worn as an everyday watch to work, date night or with a suit. Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist. I sometimes prefer wearing a man’s watch and this one is perfect without looking too large and over the top. Highly recommend this watch as the perfect, classic accessory to up-level any outfit for guys or all the on-trend ladies out there!",Extra 25% off use: FRIEND,https://www.macys.com/shop/product/movado-swiss-museum-classic-collection-leather-strap-watches?ID=6273060&CategoryID=65993&isDlp=true,Men's Swiss Museum Classic Black Leather Strap Watch 40mm

The watch was an aesy choice at a good price.,The best watch for me, I love it, It's super awesome! I can wear it all day without getting annoy by it. It is very lightweight so I can't hardly feel its weight on my wrist.,SO CLASSY!, I just bought this watch and it feels so good! Looks amazing and gurl i got so many compliments on it!

THIS IS SUPER SIMPLE AND SO SO CLASSY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY AGAIN. BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BEST FOR A MATURE WOMEN OR A CAREER LADY. NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A TEENAGER.,Beautiful watch, What a stunning watch this is. It is a very classic looking watch. One that never goes out of style. The face is simple, elegant yet makes a bold statement.
The band is beautiful as well. I wish they made this same watch in a ladies.... I almost kept it for myself instead of giving it as a gift.,I got this Movado watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. As soon as he opened the box his face got light up when he saw this amazing watch. He loves that is very light weight and that he can wear it for so many ocassions. Thank you Macy’s for making my Christmas Day extra special!,The timepiece is lightweight, classic and looks exactly as pictured. Due to the cognac band and black watchface it could go with just about everything! The quality is absolutely amazing! In classic Movado form this doesn't have number dials but while looking at it you can imagine the dials on there and still be able to tell time or simply wear it as a fashion piece. I love this timepiece and the Movado brand!,Perfect watch, boyfriend loves it! It is simple and elegant. It can be worn as an everyday watch to work, date night or with a suit. Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist. I sometimes prefer wearing a man’s watch and this one is perfect without looking too large and over the top. Highly recommend this watch as the perfect, classic accessory to up-level any outfit for guys or all the on-trend ladies out there!",Extra 25% off use: FRIEND,https://www.macys.com/shop/product/movado-swiss-museum-classic-collection-leather-strap-watches?ID=6273055&CategoryID=65993&isDlp=true,Men's Swiss Museum Classic Black Leather Strap Watch 40mm

From Movado.",$795.00,99%,16,"Best watch I own!, I ordered this new Movado Bold watch line this month. Their new Navy line includes four new watches. This one is by far the very best! The face of the watch is a good size for a man, even though I'm use to having a 44mm watch or larger. You can tell that the watch is navy blue. The dial is extremely darker than the watch, but telling the time is still visible. The finish looks great in person. It is extremely shinier than what the online pic suggests. I thought that the watch was pricey, but it is well worth it. Because of price I'm concerned about scratching up the finish on the watch. Overall, I can't wait to wear this out this weekend. I'll be wearing it at a sports bar with my Michigan Wolverines attire on. No one cares for the Spartans...Go Blue!!!,Great buy!!, Bought this watch for my husband for our anniversary 2 weeks back.

The band is beautiful as well. I wish they made this same watch in a ladies.... I almost kept it for myself instead of giving it as a gift.,I got this Movado watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. As soon as he opened the box his face got light up when he saw this amazing watch. He loves that is very light weight and that he can wear it for so many ocassions. Thank you Macy’s for making my Christmas Day extra special!,The timepiece is lightweight, classic and looks exactly as pictured. Due to the cognac band and black watchface it could go with just about everything! The quality is absolutely amazing! In classic Movado form this doesn't have number dials but while looking at it you can imagine the dials on there and still be able to tell time or simply wear it as a fashion piece. I love this timepiece and the Movado brand!,Perfect watch, boyfriend loves it! It is simple and elegant. It can be worn as an everyday watch to work, date night or with a suit. Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist. I sometimes prefer wearing a man’s watch and this one is perfect without looking too large and over the top. Highly recommend this watch as the perfect, classic accessory to up-level any outfit for guys or all the on-trend ladies out there!",Extra 25% off use: FRIEND,https://www.macys.com/shop/product/movado-swiss-museum-classic-collection-leather-strap-watches?ID=6273054&CategoryID=65993&isDlp=true,Men's Swiss Museum Classic Black Leather Strap Watch 40mm

Quality is very durable as with any other Movado.,This is an awesome watch! It is very stylish, but also very elegant in a professional setting.

You can't read the word ""Movado"" on it, unless you put it 2 inches from your eyes, and even then you need to squint. The circle on the top is not visible.

Thanks to the expert watch dept at Macys Herald Square we were able to take out 1 and 1/2 links to make his watch the perfect fit!,great watch! feels great on the wrist. i would definitely recommend this watch to anyone who likes an all black watch. especially on a bracelet.,Great purchase and good prices .

I love it.. It's the best of both! Casual and sporty at the same time. I like that it's all black! It looks even better in person!,Nice watch, not for a man., It's a nice watch overall, sad that the wristband isnt ALL stainless steel. Would like MUCH nicer that way. But it is not, its rubber and steel and makes the watch look cheap. All the other versions of this same watch is all stainless steel except this one,He LOVED it!, Bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift last year and he absolutely loved it! So classy and chic on the arm. Always wears it to business meetings and important events. I love the black on black bold watch more than any other color, its just more sophisticated and he agrees!,Purchase, I purchased this watch, got it, was not pleased at all with the clasp that was on it so plan on returning it to the store soon. Plus it was hard to read the time in low light, also face is smaller the most watches but overall really nice look to it.,Nice, I’m a huge Movado fan & but I didn’t particularly care for this watch. Its not unisex for starters very masculine. The band is polymer & stainless which in my opinion takes away from the chic nature of the brand. It’s a no for me.,Amazing purchase!, I bought this watch for my boyfriend & he loves it! It's perfect for him! It's an everyday watch, it's simple, not too big, and I love that it's a solid black watch. Plus, Movado is a great brand!,Elegant but impractical, Beautiful watch but not practical whatsoever. Be aware that it's impossible to tell time in low light conditions because of the black dial and dark hands. That's the reason I returned the watch.,Wow! The Movado Black, I purchased this watch for my beau for Christmas. He LOVED it. He gets tons of compliments. The downside...the watch is so dark that it can be difficult to see it without light. Movado has always been my choice for watches.,Beautiful, My boyfriend loved it. It's very sleek and it compliments any outfit.,Nice.., I bought this watch a year ago was my first Movado after that I have been buying Movado watches I love them.
This watch is nice I really like it small and it looks very nice,Its a movado!, Watch is great but the picture doesn't do it justice must see in person, it doe's run a little small for a men's watch but its still a Movado!

Nice color contrast between black and cognac. The bands fits comfortable.
*Ladies, this will be the perfect gift for your man!!!,I like the Classic Movado look, good quality, nice color scheme, and it's quiet. I also like that the second band catch is sewn onto the band. I don't like that the leather is stiff upon intial break in period, holes in the band seem either too tight or too loose, and the leather band itself doesn't feel comfortable.
Overall a decent watch if you have a smaller wrist.,My husband absolutely loved this watch. Classic, yet trend, with a bomb craftsmanship to match. Looking for quality and style? This is it!,This Movado Museum watch will make an excellent gift for any man in your life. It is a classic but luxury watch that can be worn very well in casual business attire.
Although this is a men's watch, I dare say that it can be used by men and women alike because it is not huge.
The diameter of the watch is 40mm. The face is black and so is the pvd-finished stainless steel case. The hands and dot on the watch are a dark silver which compliment the black elegantly.
The straps are a beautiful cognac brown and are labeled as genuine leather. The buckles are a dark silver that matches the hands and dot of the watch. Overall the colors compliment eachother nicely.
The width of the strap is 5/8ths of an inch and the length altogether is 9 1/8th inches. With this in mind this watch will barely fit a man who is heavier or has thick arms. For example, my S/O wears a 3x and this barely fits, it is snug so definitely this wont accommodate larger folks.
Overall the watch is of an impeccable design, it is classic luxury and is very comfortable, not at all itchy or rough. The only concerns are that the sizing isn't all inclusive for bigger men, any accidental scratches on the face of the watch will be very noticeable and if you are not excellent at reading a watch or familiar with where the hours and minutes are on a watch, you risk not being able to read this watch because there are literally zero indications of where the numbers go.,I do recommend this watch, it is a stunning classic piece that any man would look great in!,This watch is an absolute beauty. It has a simple, classic Movado design and is quite lightweight. The length of the band does run a little small so it’s better for smaller wrists than wider wrists. It can pass as a more contemporary look.,The watch is very elegant. This Movado watch looks good dressed up or with a casual outfit. It has the perfect color coordination. The only complaint I have is the band. I would recommend a clamp band instead of a buckle band. This is driven by the fact that Movado is a luxury watch. But overall I love this watch and will keep it for years.,Everyone deserves a little luxe in their life and the Movado Men’s Swiss Museum Watch definitely fits the bill. The beautiful, black mirrored face goes with everything and the band is a high quality, supple leather that rests beautifully and comfortably against your wrist. I sometimes prefer wearing a man’s watch and this one is perfect without looking too large and over the top. Highly recommend this watch as the perfect, classic accessory to up-level any outfit for guys or all the on-trend ladies out there!",Extra 25% off use: FRIEND,https://www.macys.com/shop/product/movado-swiss-museum-classic-collection-leather-strap-watches?ID=6273056&CategoryID=65993&isDlp=true,Men's Swiss Museum Classic Black Leather Strap Watch 40mm
