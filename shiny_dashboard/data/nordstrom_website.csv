Many other ceramic watches from other brands have some other design elements that can look gaudy. This watch is a great weight, simple yet bold, and the blush color is really pretty. It's not pink, it's a very champagne tinged blush color. I've seen the white and black in the store too and those look just as pretty (with different feels, because of the color). I've never been able to find a ceramic watch that I finally invested in and loved, until now.\nTaiwanMama Sweepstakes entry\nSept 16, 2019"", ""Elegant with Style\nLove my Blush Pink Movado Bold! I went shopping for a bracelet but couldn't resist this ceramic beauty. The color doesn't scream pink (it's more of a pink-champagne) is SO attractive. The size is large but not too big and I've received compliments every time I've worn it. Don't hesitate to purchase this watch. I'm extremely pleased with my Movado Bold.\nMichgal1 Sweepstakes entry\nMay 25, 2019"", 'beautiful piece\nHighly recommend. I purchased as a Mother’s Day present. It fits my mother beautifully.

I've also received several compliments on it so far.\nCAmom40s Sweepstakes entry\nApr 30, 2019"", ""A forever watch.\nA forever watch. I cannot seem to recover from how THRILLED I am with this purchase...I just keep gazing at it as if I am in love.....and I am. At $595, definitely a splurge for me, but I have admired Movado watches for a couple decades, tried to appease myself with less expensive sleek, modern-look costume jewelry watches, and have even come very close to buying a Movado Bold in silver/rose gold during the Anniversary sale. I am sooooo glad I didn't, because this white watch is hands-down (pun intended) BEYOND STUNNING.

Like another reviewer, I have been on the hunt for a gold watch and did not want to spend tons of money. When I saw this, I thought it would fit the bill. Unfortunately, the first time I wore it - to lunch mind you - I discovered that the face scratched on the edge. It was small, but there nonetheless. Unfortunately, because it is a mineral crystal, it is softer than a sapphire crystal and more prone to scratching. Plus, the way the face is designed, the crystal edge is not protcted. Nordstroms was wonderful, and offered to send it out for repairs. But I knew based on the design and the type of crystal used I was going to have to be careful with it. So if you are gentle with your jewelry, by all means go for it. But I don't like things I need to baby so I returned it.
