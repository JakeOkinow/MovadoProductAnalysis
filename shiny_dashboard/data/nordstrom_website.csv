You can dress it up or down I'm super happy with my purchase.. Got this on the anniversary sale what a great buy!\nNette123 Sweepstakes entry\nAug 26, 2019"", ""Do not buy!!!!\nFor the price of this watch I am extremely dissatisfied - I'm not sure if I got a lemon or if this is just the quality. I bought this at Anniversary Sale and the clasp will not stay shut and after three wears the back is completely tarnished. I have a lot of nice jewelry so I know how to take care of my items and I am beyond annoyed with this purchased because the watch itself is very cute. I've lost complete trust in this brand.\nSNfangirl314 Sweepstakes entry\nAug 5, 2019""]",https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/movado-bold-glitz-bracelet-watch-36mm/5257771?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&breadcrumb=Home%2FAll%20Results&color=gold
